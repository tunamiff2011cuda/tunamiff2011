Numerical simulations of Far-filed tsunamis:

Tohoku University’s Numerical Analysis Model for Investigation of Far-field Tsunamis – TUNAMI FF

Assumptions:

        The astronomical tides do not vary with respect to time throughout the tsunami simulation. The Still water Level in the computation is set equal to the water level at the beginning of the simulation
        Both temporal and spatial grid lengths vary only at the ratio of 1:3:9 and so on, if the change of them is necessary
        In the linear computation, no run up can be included, and therefore the computation is not carried out for the water depth shallower than 0.1 cm, and vertical walls are set in place of the actual slope.

Numerical simulations of far-filed tsunamis, representing transoceanic propagation requires large area of computation. Such numerical simulations of far-filed tsunamis which travels more than 1000 km over ocean should be computed in polar-coordinates by considering earth as sphere of radius R, covered by the latitude and longitude (theta, lambda). Far-filed tsunami simulations covering wide areas of computation, in turn long travel distance may yield dispersion of wave components. Therefore in order to include physical dispersion term the equations of higher order approximation are used. But long travel time yields an inevitable accumulation of numerical error, for which the computation programme should be carefully designed.

In the method of simulation, the linear long wave theory is expressed in latitude-longitude coordinates with different formulation of equations. When the liner theory is used, it is very easy to attain a high rate of vectorization in terms of programming. The current TUNAMI FF program for transoceanic propagation is composed to fully utilize the vectorizaion of parallel programming. The rate of vectorization of higher than 99% is a result of elimination of both the IF-sentences in DO-groups and the division operation.

Initial profile computation

The vertical displacement of sea bottom is calculated with the Mansinha and Smylie method (1972), and is assumed equal to the tsunami initial profile with no modification of hydraulic effect because the horizontal size of the initial profile is sufficiently large compared to the water depth at the tsunami source.

Main Program Flow

The Variables and Statements used in main program summarized as below:

    Specification statement

M and N stated as REAL

In each domain, three-dimensional arrays for Z, M, N, DZ, DM and DN as well as two-dimensional arrays HZ, HM, HN, IR and IB; Note that declaration of BT(10) is crucial.

Dimensions for space are increased by one in order to include an extra row or column outside the domain under consideration. Otherwise, discharge on the boundary or IB and IR maps are sometimes not definable, according to the way of selection of I and J axes. Dimensions for time always taken to be 2, because values are changed by a subroutine CHANGE

    Input of setting values

Values of DX, DT and R(=DT/DX) are Inputs for every domain

    Setting of initial value

CALL DEPTH0 – with this command, data of water depth HZ, IB and IR maps are input in every domain. To build this subroutine of data input, the following points are taken into consideration.

    Water depth – Read water depths HZ on hydrographic charts with the z-axis positive downwards
    IB map ( a two-dimensional array) – An IB map gives the method of computation and the existence of vertical walls.

According to following rule, positive integers of one or two figures are allotted to and Input into every grid point in every domain

    The unit digit = 0, the computation is with the linear theory without the convection term
    The unit digit = 1, the computation is with the non-linear theory with the convection term included
    The tenth digit = 1, the discharge flux M in the I-direction is zero, owing to the existence of a vertical wall
    The tenth digit =2, the discharge flux N in the J-direction is zero, owing to the existence of a vertical wall
    The tenth digit = 3, the discharge fluxes M and N in the I and J directions are zero, owing to the existence of a vertical wall.
    The tenth digit = 4, no computation made

 

    IR map ( a two-dimensional array) – this map shows the existence of such structures as sea walls of finite crown height. according to the following rule, positive integers of one or two figures ae allotted to and Input into every grid point in every domain
    The unit digit, assign the address I (=1~9) of BT(I), data of the crown height of sea walls
    No tenth digit, no sea wall
    The tenth digit = 1, there is a sea wall on the computation line of discharge M in the I-direction
    The tenth digit = 2, there is a sea wall on the computation line of discharge N in the J-direction
    The tenth digit = 3, there is a sea wall both on the computation lines of discharge M and N in the I- and J- directions

CALL DEPTH – with this command, water depths HM and HN at the point where the discharge is computed are calculated. A call statement is necessary for a computation domain

CALL SETZRO – with this command, initial values are set for Z, M, N and DZ, all of which are set equal to zero. A call statement is necessary for a computation domain

    Repetition of computation with respect to time

CALL CONTIN – with this command, the water depth Z at the next time step Is computed with the equation of continuity. A call statement is necessary for a computation domain

CALL JOINTZ – with this command, the water depth is connected between domains of different time and space grid lengths. A call statement is necessary for a line of connection.

CALL MOTION – with this command, the discharges M and N at the next time step Is computed with the equation of motion. Discharges over sea walls are evaluated with the Hom-ma formula. A call statement is necessary for a computation domain

CALL BOUND – with this command, the conditions are Input at the seaside boundary. Input data of a tsunami should be prepared

CALL JOINTQ – with this command, the discharge is connected between domains of different time and space grid lengths. A call statement is necessary for a line of connection.

CALL OUTPUT – A subroutine is added at need, to output the computed results

CALL CHANGE – old data one time step before are changed with new data. For instance, newly obtained Z(I, J, 2) replaces old data and become Z(I, J, 1) which Is used in the next computation.

    Time step index – If the time step delta t varies from a domain to another, the computation procedures from CONTIN to CHANGE, those mentioned above is not always carried out at every time step except in the domain of smallest delta t. The time step at which the computation is carried out in the other domains is controlled by introducing the “time step index”.

# GNU LESSER GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE 
Version 3, 29 June 2007 
Copyright (C) 2007 Free Software Foundation, Inc. <http://fsf.org/> 

Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies  of this license document, but changing it is not allowed. 
This version of the GNU Lesser General Public License incorporates the terms and conditions of version 3 of the GNU General Public License, supplemented by the additional permissions listed below. 

0. Additional Definitions. 
As used herein, "this License" refers to version 3 of the GNU Lesser General Public License, and the "GNU GPL" refers to version 3 of the GNU General Public License. 

"The Library" refers to a covered work governed by this License, other than an Application or a Combined Work as defined below. 
An "Application" is any work that makes use of an interface provided by the Library, but which is not otherwise based on the Library.  Defining a subclass of a class defined by the Library is deemed a mode of using an interface provided by the Library. 

A "Combined Work" is a work produced by combining or linking an Application with the Library. The particular version of the Library with which the Combined Work was made is also called the "Linked Version". 

The "Minimal Corresponding Source" for a Combined Work means the Corresponding Source for the Combined Work, excluding any source code for portions of the Combined Work that, considered in isolation, are based on the Application, and not on the Linked Version. 

The "Corresponding Application Code" for a Combined Work means the object code and/or source code for the Application, including any data and utility programs needed for reproducing the Combined Work from the Application, but excluding the System Libraries of the Combined Work. 

1. Exception to Section 3 of the GNU GPL. 
You may convey a covered work under sections 3 and 4 of this License without being bound by section 3 of the GNU GPL. 

2. Conveying Modified Versions. 
If you modify a copy of the Library, and, in your modifications, a facility refers to a function or data to be supplied by an Application that uses the facility (other than as an argument passed when the facility is invoked), then you may convey a copy of the modified version: 

a) under this License, provided that you make a good faith effort to ensure that, in the event an Application does not supply the function or data, the facility still operates, and performs whatever part of its purpose remains meaningful, or 

b) under the GNU GPL, with none of the additional permissions of this License applicable to that copy. 

3. Object Code Incorporating Material from Library Header Files. 
The object code form of an Application may incorporate material from a header file that is part of the Library.  You may convey such object code under terms of your choice, provided that, if the incorporated material is not limited to numerical parameters, data structure layouts and accessors, or small macros, inline functions and templates (ten or fewer lines in length), you do both of the following: 

a) Give prominent notice with each copy of the object code that the  Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are covered by this License. 

b) Accompany the object code with a copy of the GNU GPL and this license document. 

4. Combined Works. 
You may convey a Combined Work under terms of your choice that, taken together, effectively do not restrict modification of the portions of the Library contained in the Combined Work and reverse engineering for debugging such modifications, if you also do each of the following: 

a) Give prominent notice with each copy of the Combined Work that  the Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are covered by this License. 

b) Accompany the Combined Work with a copy of the GNU GPL and this license document. 

c) For a Combined Work that displays copyright notices during  execution, include the copyright notice for the Library among these notices, as well as a reference directing the user to the copies of the GNU GPL and this license document. 

d) Do one of the following: 

0) Convey the Minimal Corresponding Source under the terms of this License, and the Corresponding Application Code in a form suitable for, and under terms that permit, the user to recombine or relink the Application with a modified version of  the Linked Version to produce a modified Combined Work, in the manner specified by section 6 of the GNU GPL for conveying Corresponding Source. 

1) Use a suitable shared library mechanism for linking with the Library.  A suitable mechanism is one that (a) uses at run time a copy of the Library already present on the user's computer system, and (b) will operate properly with a modified version of the Library that is interface-compatible with the Linked Version. 

e) Provide Installation Information, but only if you would otherwise be required to provide such information under section 6 of the GNU GPL, and only to the extent that such information is necessary to install and execute a modified version of the Combined Work produced by recombining or relinking the Application with a modified version of the Linked Version. (If  you use option 4d0, the Installation Information must accompany  the Minimal Corresponding Source and Corresponding Application    Code. If you use option 4d1, you must provide the Installation Information in the manner specified by section 6 of the GNU GPL for conveying Corresponding Source.) 

5. Combined Libraries. 
You may place library facilities that are a work based on the Library side by side in a single 
library together with other library facilities that are not Applications and are not covered by this 
License, and convey such a combined library under terms of your choice, if you do both of the 
following: 

a) Accompany the combined library with a copy of the same work based on the Library, uncombined with any other library facilities, conveyed under the terms of this License. 

b) Give prominent notice with the combined library that part of it is a work based on the Library, and explaining where to find the accompanying uncombined form of the same work. 

6. Revised Versions of the GNU Lesser General Public License. 
The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of the GNU Lesser General Public License from time to time. Such new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns. 

Each version is given a distinguishing version number. If the Library as you received it specifies that a certain numbered version of the GNU Lesser General Public License "or any later version" applies to it, you have the option of following the terms and conditions either of that published version or of any later version published by the Free Software Foundation. If the Library as you received it does not specify a version number of the GNU Lesser General Public License, you may choose any version of the GNU Lesser General Public License ever published by the Free Software Foundation. 

If the Library as you received it specifies that a proxy can decide whether future versions of the GNU Lesser General Public License shall apply, that proxy's public statement of acceptance of any version is permanent authorization for you to choose that version for the Library.
